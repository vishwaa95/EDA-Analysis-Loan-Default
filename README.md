## General Information
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. For a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers we will use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.<br>

When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:<br>

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company<br>

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## Conclusions
* For defaulters, the people in their surrounding defaulting in the past 30 and 60 days has a high correlation.
* The defaulters category does not have very large number of high income clients.
